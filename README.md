### We are MKRG ("Maker-G"): Manya, Katja, Ruhani, and Geoff. 

We're the team behind WellSpring, a web app that promotes healthy habits and overall wellness.

## What can you do with WellSpring? ☀️

WellSpring acts as a daily tracker for a number of health attributes, such as hydration, nutrition, sleep, and exercise. 

Here is a guide on how to use the various pages on the site:

The Tracking page, also known as the Home page, allows you to track each of your health attributes. You can achieve this using the health wheel by clicking on one of the quadrants.

### Dashboard 📍

The Dashboard can be accessed via the navigation bar at the top. It provides a day-by-day summary of your health stats in each category.
