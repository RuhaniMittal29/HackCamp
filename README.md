## What can you do with WellSpring? ☀️

In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to overlook our daily health habits. We often find ourselves neglecting basic needs like staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, or maintaining a balanced diet. With so much information out there, it can be overwhelming to know where to start when it comes to improving your health. 

This is where WellSpring comes in. Our goal is to make health tracking simple, accessible, and actionable—empowering users to improve their well-being one day at a time. By tracking key health metrics, WellSpring provides insights and guidance to help you make informed decisions about your daily habits.

Here is a guide on how to use the various pages on the site:

### Tracking 📈

The Tracking page, also known as the Home page, allows you to track each of your health attributes. You can achieve this using the health wheel by clicking on one of the quadrants.

### Dashboard 📍

The Dashboard can be accessed via the navigation bar at the top. It provides a day-by-day summary of your health stats in each category.

### Resources 📋

Our Resources page, also accessible via the navigation bar, provides an extensive database of health articles, all just a search away.
